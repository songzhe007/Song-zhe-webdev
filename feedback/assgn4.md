Looks good overall. For organization, I would try and seperate your server side files from your client side files. 
You have some bugs and lost a few points to do with updating newly created items.

e.g. delete doesn't on a newly created user. You update doesn't work on newly created websites/pages.

Also, your reordering of widgets isn't being saved server side.
